# Maevis - Query Cache

## OVERVIEW:
  Maevis is a service that runs inbetween your client and your target Vertica database. When a query is executed against Maevis, Maevis first checks its query cache to see if the query has previously been executed:
* If the query has not been run, it's executed against the target Vertica database--the resultset is sent back to your client and stored in a Cache Database.
 * If the query has been run before, Maevis will retrieve the resultset from the Cache Database and send it back to your client. See details below under the `Message Flow` section.

#### REQUIREMENTS:
* Vertica DB - This is the querying/target Database.
* DynamoDB - This is the where cached-results are stored. There is a setting to run the cache in memory, but features will be more limited (ie, clearing specific cached queries when a table is updated).

## UTILIZATION:

#### Running
* Paramaters are read from `./constants.py`. This is where configurations for target host:port, local port, & AWS Credentails are read from. Edit these as needed.
* Run `./service.py`
* Connect your client to the host `./service.py` is running on using the LOCAL_PORT from `./constants.py`.

#### Clearing Individual Items
* When a query is written to the cache, tables/views from the Query are written to a seperate table (`from constants import CACHE_TABLE_NAME`). This table stores each table used in the query along with the cache_key (FK to the query_cache table `from constants import QUERY_CACHE_NAME` )

* To remove an item from the cache (ie, at the end of an ETL job) read the cache_keys from the `cache_table` table (scanning based on the table that is refreshed) and delete those keys from the `query_cache` table. 

* TBD: ./py job will be created to clear a table from cache than can be executed at the end of ETL.

#### Notes:
* A query will only read from the Cache Database if the query is identical to a previously executed query. For example, changing a table alias within a query will result in a new hash thus re-reading from the target DB.
* Maevis will only cache results that are less < 380KB. The Cache database is designed for aggregations over large datasets. 
* If the cache server is slower than expected or queries unexepectedly fail, consider upping AWS Capacity Units. This is configured in `./constants.py`
* Tables in the Cache Server are dropped and re-created on restart. Note that it will take a minute or two for this to process after running `./service.py` before you can query through Maevis.
